# How to create react app without using webpack?

-   [Link to my YouTube video](https://youtu.be/vKsB_1BOPLM)

## Description

-   Demonstrate why do we require packages like Webpack or Browserify
-   Also without a transcompiler (like Babel) the browser wont understand nodejs syntax
-   We would be using cdn scripts for react, react-dom and babel.
-   This is the bare minimum construct for a small scale react app

## If you want to use this repository just...

-   git clone https://github.com/lord-markosa/YouTube_react_without_webpack.git
-   npm install wont be required because we are using cdn scripts
